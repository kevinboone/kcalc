KCalc 9.0 - a Lua-based command-line calculator 
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>kcalc</B>

[options]&nbsp;[expression]

<P>

<P>
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
<I>KCalc</I> is a command-line expression evaluator and math library based on
the Lua programming language. It is designed to occupy a place between simple
pocket calculator-type applications, and heavyweights like Octave and Matlab.
Like the heavyweights it has full support for complex numbers, and is
extensible with scripts (in this case, using the Lua language).  Unlike them,
it consumes less than a megayte of storage and neglibible RAM.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OVERVIEW OF OPERATION</H2>

<P>
When invoked without arguments, <B>kcalc</B> enters interactive mode. 
Expressions or statements are read from standard input, evaluated, and
results displayed, if any. If invoked with arguments, the arguments
are concatenated and treated as an expression. Care needs to be taken
when entering an expression this way, as some symbols that commonly 
appear in expressions (particularly parentheses) have a meaning to
the shell. 
<P>
Statements are preceded by an exclamation mark (!); any other input is
interpreted as an expression.  See the section SYNTAX below for more details of
the input format.
<P>
<I>KCalc</I> will read from standard input until it either gets a complete
statement or a complete expression, or the syntax is so broken that it cannot
be corrected by further input. In interactive mode, the prompt will change to
show '...' when further input is expected. When taking input from a source that
is not a terminal/console (redirected from a file, for example), no prompt is
shown, but the input data will still be interpreted the same way.  For example,
the input
<P>
<PRE>
!x=1
2*x
</PRE>

<P>
sets <B>x</B> to 1 and then evalutes <I>2*x</I>. The same result is 
obtained if the input is: 
<P>
<PRE>
!x=
1
2*
x
</PRE>

<P>
In particular, you don't need to repeat the ! symbol when continuing a
statement, whether the input is from a terminal/console or some
other source. 
<P>
On systems that support GNU readline, <I>KCalc</I> will attempt to complete
a function name when the Tab key is pressed. The list of possible completions
is taken from functions which have <I>help()</I> entries, and a few
other things (<I>last</I>, <I>quit</I>, etc). variables and constants are
not considered as possible completions unless they also have help
entries.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>GETTING HELP </H2>

<P>
In interactive mode, enter '<I>help()</I>' to get more 
information. To get information about a specific function, enter
<I>help('{function_name}')</I>. There are other topics for which
in-program help is available; <I>help()</I> on its own will show a 
list. 
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNTAX </H2>

<P>
Input must be a mathematical expression, valid in the Lua language,
or a Lua statement preceded with a ! character. There are a few
exceptions, allowed for convenience: the string 'help' displays
brief help, and 'quit' exits the program. Lua expressions follow
ordinary algebraic notation, so the syntax should not produce any 
surprises. Any input that is not preceded by ! will display a value,
although that value might be <I>nil</I> if the expression does not
produce a result. An expression that is not expected to produce a
result can be preceded by a ! simply to suppress the 'nil' message.
Input that is a statement, rather than an expression, <I>must</I> be
preceded by a ! -- it is an error not to do so. Statements include,
for example, variable definitions:
<P>
<PRE>
expr&gt; !p4=pi/4
expr&gt; tan(p4)
1
</PRE>

<P>
Numbers are assumed to be decimal, unless they are prefixed with '0x', 
to indicate a hexadecimal value. Scientific notation can be used to enter
small or large values, e.g.: 1.2e4, 12.3E-4. 
<P>
Complex numbers should be entered in the form 'x + y*i'. That is,
although <I>KCalc</I> will display complex numbers in the form
<BR>&nbsp;'x+yi',&nbsp;an&nbsp;explicit&nbsp;multiplication&nbsp;by&nbsp;'i'&nbsp;needs&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;used&nbsp;to
enter complex numbers.
<P>
The implicit variable <I>last</I> can be used in any expression to
refer to the result of the last computation.
<P>
Some built-in functions take arrays as arguments. Arrays are
defined using curly brackets; for example:
<P>
<PRE>
expr&gt; max({1,2,3}) 
3
</PRE>

<P>
The size of array <I>ary</I> can be obtained using the construct
<I>#ary</I>; as in Lua, arrays are indexed from 1, not from 0.
<P>
Arrays are also used to represent vectors; see the VECTORS section
for more details.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>STARTUP</H2>

<P>
At startup, <I>KCalc</I> reads a number of scripts. These are either in
the system script directory or the user script directory. In particular,
it reads the script <I>kcalcrc.lua</I>, if it exists, from the
user script directory. This is the place to add user-specific 
customizations to <I>KCalc</I>, or simply to set up preferences for
things like number formatting.
<P>
The locations of the script directory vary from platform to platform.
Run <I>kcalc -v</I> to display them.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DISPLAY FORMAT </H2>

<P>
The function <I>format(string)</I> controls how the results of a calculation
are displayed. <I>string</I> is one of a set of tags that are broadly
similar to those used in Matlab: short, long, shortE, longE, shortG,
longG, bank, rat, and hex. Not all kinds of result can be displayed
in all formats, and <I>kcalc</I> displays an error message in such cases,
rather than a result in a different format, which might be confusing.
For example, 'hex' mode can only display real, positive numbers.
<P>
To get a complete list of formats, run <I>help('format')</I>/
<P>
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Strict display mode</H3>

<P>
In general, the results output by <I>KCalc</I> cannot be assumed to
be suitable for input in further expressions. If the result is a 
string, for example, it would need to be enclosed in quotes to be
used in a subsequent expression. In general, the output format attempts
to be compact, so we see '2i' rather than '2*i', even though '2*i' is 
a valid expression and '2i' is not. 
<P>
Defining the variable <I>_kcalc_strict=true</I> will make <I>KCalc</I>
attempt to output data in a form suitable for direct use in 
another expression.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Rational approximation</H3>

<P>
In 'rational' mode (<I>format('rat')</I>) <I>kcalc</I> will try to
display output as the fraction with the smallest denominator whose
value is within a certain tolerance of the result. The default 
tolerance is about 3 significant figures. Because the algorithm looks
for the smallest denominator rather than the closest tolerance, the 
result can be unexpected. For example, 0.001 is rendered as
<BR>&nbsp;'1/991',&nbsp;because&nbsp;991&nbsp;is&nbsp;the&nbsp;smallest&nbsp;denominator&nbsp;that&nbsp;satisfies&nbsp;the
tolerance requirement. Obviously, '1/1000' would be better, but
the algorithm won't continue once it's found a match. In many cases, 
the algorithm produces the expected result, and quite quickly; but
if greater control is required of the output, consider using the
<I>dec2rat</I> function explicitly. Note that 'rat' mode does work with
complex numbers, but the results will often look rather ugly and
confusing.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="lbAL">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-i</B>

<DD>
Continue to enter interactive mode, even in situations where 
<I>KCalc</I> would normally stop (for example, an expression was
specified on the command line).
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-s&nbsp;{file}</B>

<DD>
Runs the specified Lua script. Note that the file specified is 
interpreted as a raw Lua script, not the input form that <I>KCalc</I>
uses for interactive mode. That is, statements don't need to be
preceded with !, and output should be produced using <I>print()</I>.
Once the script has been executed, <I>KCalc</I> will stop, unless
forced to continue by the <B>-i</B> switch.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-v</B>

<DD>
Display the version infomation, and some configuration details
such as the locations of the script directories. 
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-w&nbsp;{cols}</B>

<DD>
Sets the display width. Long output, such as the help text associated with
particular functions, will be split up at word boundaries to fit the screen.
If no width is set, <I>KCalc</I> will try to work out the screen width, and
default to 80 characters if it can't. If output is not to a TTY device, then
the width can still be set. In this case, however, text is not broken at
all if no width is set.
<P>
Note that this formatting only applies to string data; numbers, tables, 
etc., will always be output on one line.
</DL>
<P>

<P>
<A NAME="lbAM">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>MODULES</H2>

<P>
<I>KCalc</I> is supplied with a basic library of trigonometric, root-finding,
financial, and statistical functions. 
Functionality can be extended easily by defining
new functions in the Lua programming language.
<P>
Unlike previous versions, <B>KCalc</B> v9.0 only loads a subset of the math
library at start-up. This is to make start-up faster on slow systems. Additional
modules can be loaded using <B>!import('module')</B>. 
<P>
Note that <B>!import()</B> behaves exactly like the Lua function
<B>require()</B>, except that it carries out some additional, internal
refresh operations. For example, newly-added function names are added
to the list of auto-completion candidates. 
<P>
To get a list of installed modules, use <B>help('modules')</B> 
<P>
New modules can be added in the system or user script directories. A
module must have a filename that ends in '.lua', and begin with a
specific comment that identifies it. The module will probably add
specific help text for its functions. Any of the predefined modules
can be used as a template for new ones.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAN">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DATA FROM FILES</H2>

<P>
<B>KCalc()</B> can read and write values from external files, which can
be particularly helpful for statistical calculations. If you need to
use a file for data, it is assumed that there are multiple data items, so
they are always read into an array.
<P>
The function <B>read_csv('file')</B> (from the <B>file</B> module) 
reads values from the file, all on one line, separated by commas,
and appends them to an array, which is returned. 
Values can themselves be arrays, which must be enclosed in {} brackets.
<P>
Alternatively, the data can just be expressed as a Lua source file. For
example, if the file <B>x.dat</B> contains the text
<P>
x = {1,2,3}
<P>
then it can be read, and the array 'x' assigned, by running
<P>
<B>!dofile ('x.dat')</B> 
<P>
The function <B>write_csv ('file', array)</B> writes the values of the
array in a suitable format for reading back using  <B>read_csv()</B> .
<P>
The function <B>write_csv2 ('file', array)</B> writes the array with
one element per line. If the elements themselves are arrays, then they
are expanded on the same line and separated by commas. This 
&quot;two-dimensional&quot; format should be suitable for writing a two-dimentional
array (array of arrays) in such a way that it can be read by a 
spreadsheet program.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAO">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>VECTORS</H2>

<P>
<I>KCalc</I> has a <B>vector</B> module that provides basic operations on
vectors, such as the dot product. Vectors are represented as Lua
arrays. Vector elements can be complex numbers, if required.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAP">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>TECHNICAL NOTES</H2>

<P>
<A NAME="lbAQ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Precision</H3>

<P>
All arithmetic is done with whatever standard double-precision 
floating-point value is provided by the C compiler. On nearly all
platforms this is a 32-bit value, giving a precision of about
sixteen significant figures, with a largest value of about 10^308
and a smallest value of about 10^-323. Because some precision is lost in
most calculation steps, many functions will not provide even the 
sixteen-figure precision that the number format offers.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAR">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Overflows</H3>

<P>
Arithmetic overflows are not considered errors; nor are divisions by zero.
Operations which overflow take the value 'huge', which can be tested. 
For example 1/0==huge' evaluates to 'true'.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAS">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Simplifying input of single-valued functions</H3>

<P>
Many <I>KCalc</I> functions take a single-valued function as an argument.
For example, the functions for finding roots do this -- they need
to have an equation to solve for zero, and the equation 
is provided as a Lua function. 
<P>
The function can be provided as a Lua function, or as a string of text.
For example, these invocations are equivalent:
<P>
expr&gt; solve_secant (&quot;x^2 + 5*x + 6&quot;, 0, -100, 1e-10)
expr&gt; solve_secant (function(x) return x^2 + 5*x + 6 end, 0, -100, 1e-7)
<P>
Both find the value of <B>x</B> that satisfies <I>x^2+5x+6=0</I> in the 
range 0 - -100, with a result correct to the seventh decimal place.
The difference is primarily one of speed: the Lua function in the 
second example only needs to be compiled once, whereas the string in the
first example is compiled on each iteration of the solver. On modern
computers, this difference is unlikely to be significant. 
<P>
It is important to understand, however, that the string representation
assumes that the independent variable is called 'x'; nothing else will
work. The Lua function does not have this -- albeit minor -- limitation.
<P>
Another way to work with single-valued functions is to define them
in advance, and then use their names:
<P>
expr&gt; !function quad(y) return y^2 + 5*y + 6 end
expr&gt; solve_secant (quad, 0, -100, 1e-7)
<P>
<A NAME="lbAT">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>BUGS AND LIMITATIONS</H2>

<P>
Hexadecimal output format only supports positive integers.
<P>
There is as yet no support for binary or octal numbers, or abitrary 
number bases.
<P>
The only supported data types, both in interactive mode and in scripts, are
floating-point numbers (which may be complex), strings, and arrays of the same
(which are actually Lua tables).  In particular, there is no integer data type.
As a result, care must be taken when testing whether two values are exactly
equal.
